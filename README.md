CSC207 - Assignment 5 (Quang and Matthew)

For this project, we decide to control the transaction amount so none of
Alice or Bob spend more than what they have in the balance. If they attempt
to send an invalid amount, the transaction is denied.

We also try to catch the wrong input nonce or wrong input transaction
amount as best as we can.
